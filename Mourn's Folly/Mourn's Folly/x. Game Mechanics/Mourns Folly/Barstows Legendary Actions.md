[[Walter Barstow#**Legendary Actions**]]

Here’s a breakdown of how **Legendary Actions** work for Barstow:

1. **How Legendary Actions Work**:
    
    - Barstow has 3 legendary actions [[per round]], which he can use at the end of another creature’s turn (not on his own turn).
    
    - He can only take one legendary action at a time, choosing from the available options.
	
    - Each round, he regains all 3 legendary actions at the start of his turn, allowing him to use them each round as needed.
	
1. **Individual Legendary Actions**:
    
    - **Move**: This action allows Barstow to move up to his full movement speed without triggering opportunity attacks. It’s useful for closing the distance on his targets, avoiding difficult situations, or repositioning to take advantage of terrain.
    
    - **Unarmed Strike**: This action lets Barstow make a single unarmed attack at the end of another creature’s turn. He can use this to deal extra damage and potentially initiate a grapple, setting up for his **Bite** on his next turn.
    
    - **Bite (Costs 2 Actions)**: This option costs 2 of his 3 legendary actions, limiting its use to once per round. If he has grappled a creature, he can follow up with a **Bite** as a legendary action, allowing him to deal significant damage and regain hit points through the **Bite**’s necrotic effect.
    
3. **Strategic Use**:
    
    - Barstow can take advantage of his **Move** and **Unarmed Strike** actions to harass opponents and force them into difficult positions.
	
    - With the **Bite** as a 2-action cost option, he can sustain himself through combat, draining life from his foes and adding to his intimidation.

Legendary actions make Barstow formidable, keeping him active during the entire combat round and preventing his enemies from easily outmaneuvering him.
