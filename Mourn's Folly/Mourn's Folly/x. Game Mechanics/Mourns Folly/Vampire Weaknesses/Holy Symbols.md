**Holy symbols** are potent tools against vampires, leveraging divine power and faith to ward off or harm undead creatures. Here’s a breakdown of how holy symbols affect vampires:

### Holy Symbols as Repellents

- **Effect**: Holy symbols can deter vampires, forcing them to keep their distance if the symbol is wielded with genuine faith and conviction.
- **Mechanics**: If a character holds a holy symbol and channels their faith, a vampire within **10 feet** may be forced to make a **Wisdom saving throw** (DC 13, or higher if blessed by a deity or cleric). On a failure, the vampire must retreat and cannot willingly approach within 10 feet for **1 minute**. If they succeed, they can resist the repellent effect but may still hesitate to attack directly.

### Infusing Weapons with Radiant Damage

- **Effect**: A holy symbol can bless weapons, giving them the power to deal extra **radiant damage** against undead.
- **Mechanics**: If a character uses a holy symbol to bless a weapon (typically requiring a spell or ritual), the weapon deals an additional **1d4 radiant damage** to vampires for **1 hour** or until the blessing fades. Some spells, like _Divine Smite_, channel radiant power through a holy symbol to amplify attacks.

### Disrupting Regeneration

- **Effect**: Holy symbols can disrupt a vampire’s regenerative abilities, stopping them from recovering injuries.
- **Mechanics**: If a vampire is struck by a weapon blessed with a holy symbol or injured in the presence of a holy symbol, it may prevent **Regeneration** for that round. A **successful attack** from a blessed weapon stops the vampire from healing until the start of their next turn.

### Turning Undead

- **Effect**: Clerics and other holy warriors can use holy symbols to attempt to “Turn” undead creatures, including vampires.
- **Mechanics**: Using a holy symbol, a cleric may cast _Turn Undead_ to compel vampires within 30 feet to **flee**. Each vampire must succeed on a **Wisdom saving throw** or be forced to retreat for **1 minute** (or until harmed). Higher-level clerics might also **Destroy Undead** if they succeed with a higher-level turn.

### Blessing Entrances and Boundaries

- **Effect**: Placing holy symbols near doors, windows, or entrances can prevent vampires from crossing.
- **Mechanics**: A holy symbol placed at a threshold or doorway may require a vampire to succeed on a **Charisma saving throw** to cross, representing the barrier of faith. Failing the save means the vampire cannot enter that space, reinforcing the area as a sanctuary from their influence.

Holy symbols, especially when paired with strong faith or clerical power, are powerful safeguards and can create strategic advantages for players facing vampires, highlighting the vampire’s vulnerability to divine and sacred forces.
