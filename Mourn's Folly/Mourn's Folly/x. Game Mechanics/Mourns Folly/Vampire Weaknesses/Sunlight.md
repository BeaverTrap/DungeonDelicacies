[[Vampire Weaknesses]]

### **Sunlight Hypersensitivity**

- **Effect**: Sunlight is toxic to vampires, causing intense physical harm.
- **Mechanics**: When a vampire starts its turn in direct sunlight, it takes **20 radiant damage**. This makes prolonged exposure deadly, as the damage is unavoidable and will quickly deplete its hit points.

### Disadvantage on Attacks and Ability Checks

- **Effect**: Sunlight blinds and weakens vampires, disrupting their focus and precision.
- **Mechanics**: While in direct sunlight, a vampire has **disadvantage on all attack rolls and ability checks**. This makes it harder for vampires to effectively engage in combat or use skills that require precision.

### Sunlight Immobilizes Vampire Regeneration

- **Effect**: Vampires cannot heal in the presence of sunlight.
- **Mechanics**: A vampire exposed to sunlight loses its **Regeneration** trait until it leaves the sun’s rays. Without the ability to regenerate, they are significantly more vulnerable to taking and retaining damage.

### Limiting Escape and Movement

- **Effect**: Sunlight restricts a vampire’s ability to safely flee or take cover.
- **Mechanics**: Vampires often avoid direct sunlight at all costs, so players can use sunlight to corner or trap them in a specific area. They may also lose access to abilities like **Spider Climb** and **Misty Escape** if they’re forced into positions where sunlight blocks or restricts those options.

### Weakening the Vampire’s Charisma-Based Abilities

- **Effect**: Sunlight reduces a vampire’s aura of intimidation and charm.
- **Mechanics**: Vampires lose access to abilities like **Charm** and **Children of the Night** while in sunlight. This limits their ability to influence and summon creatures, making it easier for players to face the vampire alone without summoned minions or charmed allies.

### Vulnerability When Grappled or Restrained in Sunlight

- **Effect**: Forcing a vampire to remain in sunlight deals continuous damage and immobilizes it.
- **Mechanics**: If players manage to grapple or restrain a vampire in direct sunlight, the vampire is immobilized, taking 20 radiant damage at the start of each turn it remains exposed. If combined with stakes or other measures, this can be a powerful method of keeping a vampire at bay or even destroying it.
