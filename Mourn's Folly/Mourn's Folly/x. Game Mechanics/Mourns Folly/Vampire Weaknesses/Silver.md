[[Vampire Weaknesses]]

### **Silver’s Effect on Vampires**

### **1. Enhanced Damage from Silvered Weapons**

- **Effect**: Silvered weapons cut through a vampire’s defenses, causing greater harm.
- **Mechanics**: When struck by a silvered weapon, vampires take an additional 1d4 radiant damage on each hit. The purity of silver disrupts their dark essence, making it more difficult for them to shrug off damage.

### **2. Blocking Regeneration**

- **Effect**: Silver interferes with a vampire’s ability to heal.
- **Mechanics**: If a vampire takes any damage from a silvered weapon, it cannot use its **Regeneration** trait until the start of its next turn. This effect is cumulative with each hit, meaning sustained attacks from silvered weapons prevent the vampire from healing naturally.

### **3. Inhibiting Shapechanging Abilities**

- **Effect**: Vampires struggle to shapeshift when exposed to silver’s touch.
- **Mechanics**: A vampire attempting to use shapechanging abilities (like mist or bat form) while holding or in contact with silver must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be unable to transform. If already transformed, they revert to their true form on a failed save.

### **4. Silver Dust as a Protective Barrier**

- **Effect**: A line of silver dust can act as a ward, blocking a vampire’s path.
- **Mechanics**: Vampires cannot cross a line of finely powdered silver dust without first dispelling or disrupting it. This creates a temporary barrier, typically lasting until the silver is disturbed or blown away. It’s a reliable but fragile ward against vampires in areas like doorways or windows.

### **5. Weakening Vampire Charms**

- **Effect**: The presence of silver disrupts a vampire’s mental influence, weakening charm effects.
- **Mechanics**: If a character carries a silver charm or amulet, any vampire attempting to charm them must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the charm effect does not take hold, and the vampire is unable to target that character with charm abilities for the next 24 hours.

### **6. Searing Pain When Touched by Silver**

- **Effect**: Direct contact with silver causes physical pain to vampires.
- **Mechanics**: A vampire touching or being touched by silver takes 1d6 radiant damage per turn of contact. This discourages vampires from directly grabbing or grappling creatures carrying silver items.
