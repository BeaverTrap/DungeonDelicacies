[[Vampire Weaknesses]]

### **Repelling Vampires**

- **Effect**: Vampires find garlic’s smell overwhelming and distasteful.
- **Mechanics**: Vampires within a 10-foot radius of garlic must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be forced to move out of the area on their next turn. This effect encourages vampires to avoid areas where garlic is present.

### **Preventing Bites**

- **Effect**: The aroma of garlic makes vampires reluctant to feed on a character.
- **Mechanics**: A vampire attempting to bite a character wearing a garlic garland must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 13). On a failure, the vampire cannot bring itself to bite the character for 1d4 hours. The garland’s scent fades and must be replaced once the duration ends.

### **Weakening Vampires' Charm Abilities**

- **Effect**: Garlic disrupts a vampire’s concentration, weakening its charm spells and abilities.
- **Mechanics**: Vampires attempting to use any charm effect on a character wearing garlic must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or suffer disadvantage on the roll. If the vampire fails this save, it cannot use charm effects on that character for 1 hour.

### **Blocking Entry**

- **Effect**: Garlic hung on windows and doorways repels vampires and prevents entry.
- **Mechanics**: A vampire cannot willingly pass through a doorway or window adorned with fresh garlic, similar to requiring an invitation to enter a residence. This effect can be bypassed if the vampire destroys or removes the garlic first, either by magical or physical means.

### **Disrupting Regeneration**

- **Effect**: Garlic weakens a vampire's regenerative abilities.
- **Mechanics**: If a vampire takes damage within 10 feet of garlic, its **Regeneration** trait is disrupted until the end of its next turn, slowing its natural healing and making it more vulnerable to ongoing attacks.


## **Garlic Garland Effect on Vampires**

- **Effect**: Vampires are instinctively repelled by the overwhelming scent of garlic and are hesitant to bite any character wearing a garlic garland.
- **Mechanics**: While wearing a garlic garland, a character gains the following protection:
    - A vampire attempting to bite them must make a **Wisdom saving throw** (DC 13). On a failure, the vampire is repelled by the scent and cannot complete the bite, losing that attack. On a success, the vampire overcomes its aversion and can proceed as normal.
- **Duration**: The garlic garland remains effective for **1d4 hours**, after which the scent fades, making it ineffective against vampires.
- **Fragility**: If the garlic garland is destroyed (e.g., torn or crushed), its effects fade within a few minutes as the remaining scent dissipates.
