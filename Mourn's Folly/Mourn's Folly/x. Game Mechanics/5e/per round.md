In combat, "per round" refers to the cycle of all combatants taking their turns. Here’s how it works in the context of **Legendary Actions** for Barstow:

- **Combat Round**: When everyone involved in the combat (both players and NPCs) has taken a turn, that completes one round.
    
- **Using Legendary Actions per Round**: Barstow can use his legendary actions at the end of **any other creature’s turn**, not just his own. He can do this repeatedly until he’s used all his available legendary actions for that round.
    
    - For example, after one player’s turn, Barstow might use his **Move** legendary action to reposition. After another player’s turn, he could use his **Unarmed Strike**. Once he’s used all 3 legendary actions, he has to wait until the start of his next turn to regain them.
- **Regain Legendary Actions**: At the start of each of his turns, he gets all 3 legendary actions back, allowing him to use them again during the next round. This cycle continues as long as the combat lasts, making him dangerous throughout each round.
