In D&D 2024 stat blocks, the **Initiative** field offers a ready-to-use initiative score based on the average roll outcome. This allows DMs to efficiently add creatures into the combat order without having to roll for each one individually. Here's how it works:

- **Calculation**: The initiative value is determined by adding the creature's Dexterity modifier to the typical average roll outcome, which is 10. For example, a creature with a Dexterity modifier of +2 would have an initiative score of +2 (12).

- **Usage**: In practice, this means that instead of rolling for the creature’s place in the initiative order, the DM can simply use the listed score to assign it a place in combat. This can be especially helpful when managing large groups or when the DM wants to streamline combat encounters.

- **Adaptability**: Although DMs can choose to roll for initiative if preferred, the listed score offers a reliable fallback to help ensure consistent and balanced placement, enhancing game flow and minimizing delay at the start of combat.


In summary, the initiative value in the stat block provides DMs a fast, consistent option for creature placement, balancing ease of use with adaptability in gameplay.

**Example**

- **Initiative +0** gives you a default initiative of **10**.
- **Initiative +1** gives you a default initiative of **11**.
- **Initiative +2** gives you a default initiative of **12**.
- **Initiative +5** gives you a default initiative of **15**.

It’s simply the modifier added to a baseline of 10, representing the average of a d20 roll (10 or 10.5 rounded down), providing a quick option for initiative placement.
