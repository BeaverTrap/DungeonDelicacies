**Predatory Transformation.** If Barstow is not in sunlight or running water, he can alter his presence and form in subtle, eerie ways. He does not fully shapeshift but instead **casts an illusion over himself**, making him appear shadowed, larger, or even subtly displacing his physical form within the darkness. This illusion allows him to blend seamlessly into shadows or trick observers into misjudging his exact location, giving him advantage on Stealth checks in dim light or darkness and imposing disadvantage on attack rolls against him from non-magical sources.

- **Presence of Dread.** When Barstow is hidden or in partial view, creatures within 30 feet feel a creeping dread, as if under his watchful eye. This effect does not impose any status effects, but creatures within range have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks to locate Barstow, as his presence distorts their senses subtly.

**Dark Resilience.** When in darkness or dim light, Barstow gains resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks. Additionally, he regains 10 hit points at the start of his turn if he has at least 1 hit point remaining and is in dim light or darkness.

**Psychic Influence.** Barstow can use his action to impose a sense of intense dread upon a creature within 30 feet that he can see, forcing them to make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the creature is frightened for 1 minute. While frightened, it must use its movement to stay at least 15 feet away from Barstow and can’t willingly move closer. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.

_**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).**_ If the vampire fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**Relentless Will.** When Barstow drops to 0 hit points outside his resting place, he does not fall unconscious. Instead, his body becomes incorporeal, like a shadow barely clinging to existence, provided he isn’t in sunlight or running water. In this form, Barstow is unable to take actions or interact with objects, and he moves with a halved speed of 15 feet. His physical form appears barely visible, flickering in and out like a faint, deathly apparition.

- **Return to Rest**: Barstow must reach his resting place within 2 hours. If he fails to reach his resting place in that time, he is destroyed. While in this state, he is vulnerable to radiant damage, and all attacks against him have advantage.
    
- **Regeneration in Rest**: Once Barstow reaches his resting place, he returns to his physical form and becomes paralyzed until he regains at least 1 hit point. After spending 1 hour in his resting place, he regains 1 hit point and resumes his normal regeneration.
    

_**Regeneration.**_ The vampire regains 20 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point and isn’t in sunlight or running water. If the vampire takes radiant damage or damage from holy water, this trait doesn’t function at the start of the vampire’s next turn.

_**Spider Climb.**_ The vampire can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.  
  
_**Mind Dominion.**_ Barstow has advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) and Charisma (Intimidation) checks against weak-minded or unfaithful creatures (DM’s discretion). He can attempt to charm creatures with low Wisdom or those struggling in their faith.

_**Vampire Weaknesses.**_ The vampire has the following flaws:

_Forbiddance._ The vampire can’t enter a residence without an invitation from one of the occupants.

_Harmed by Running Water._ The vampire takes 20 acid damage if it ends its turn in running water.

_Stake to the Heart._ If a piercing weapon made of wood is driven into the vampire’s heart while the vampire is [incapacitated](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) in its resting place, the vampire is [paralyzed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ParalyzedCondition) until the stake is removed.

_Sunlight Hypersensitivity._ The vampire takes 20 radiant damage when it starts its turn in sunlight. While in sunlight, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.

Actions

_**Multiattack. (Vampire Form Only).**_ The vampire makes two attacks, only one of which can be a bite attack.

_**Unarmed Strike (Vampire Form Only).** Melee Weapon Attack:_ +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. _Hit:_ 8 (1d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage. Instead of dealing damage, the vampire can grapple the target (escape DC 18).

_**Bite. (Bat or Vampire Form Only).** Melee Weapon Attack:_ +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one willing creature, or a creature that is [grappled](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#GrappledCondition) by the vampire, [incapacitated](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition), or [restrained](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#RestrainedCondition). _Hit:_ 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) necrotic damage. The target’s hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and the vampire regains hit points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0. A humanoid slain in this way and then buried in the ground rises the following night as a [vampire spawn](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17044-vampire-spawn) under the vampire’s control.

_**Charm.**_ The vampire targets one humanoid it can see within 30 feet of it. If the target can see the vampire, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or be [charmed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CharmedCondition) by the vampire. The [charmed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CharmedCondition) target regards the vampire as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. Although the target isn’t under the vampire’s control, it takes the vampire’s requests or actions in the most favorable way it can, and it is a willing target for the vampire’s bite attack.

Each time the vampire or the vampire’s companions do anything harmful to the target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until the vampire is destroyed, is on a different plane of existence than the target, or takes a bonus action to end the effect.

_**Children of the Night (1/Day).**_ The vampire magically calls 2d4 [swarms of bats](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17028-swarm-of-bats) or [rats](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17032-swarm-of-rats), provided that the sun isn’t up. While outdoors, the vampire can call 3d6 [wolves](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17062-wolf) instead. The called creatures arrive in 1d4 rounds, acting as allies of the vampire and obeying its spoken commands. The beasts remain for 1 hour, until the vampire dies, or until the vampire dismisses them as a bonus action.

Legendary Actions

The vampire can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. The vampire regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

**Move.** The vampire moves up to its speed without provoking opportunity attacks.

**Unarmed Strike.** The vampire makes one unarmed strike.

**Bite (Costs 2 Actions).** The vampire makes one bite attack.

[[Barstows Legendary Actions]]

![[Walter_Barstow.png]]

**Appearance**: Walter Barstow is a ghastly, bat-like figure, shaped and scarred by centuries of dark existence. His skin is stretched taut and thin, nearly translucent, over a skeletal frame that seems barely capable of supporting his weight. His limbs are elongated, ending in sharp, talon-like claws, and his face is a chilling vision of vampiric evolution: razor-sharp features, hollowed cheeks, and fangs that peek from a twisted, lipless mouth. His eyes are an unnatural blend of yellow, orange, and red, glowing faintly even in the darkest shadows, piercing through any concealment.

Barstow's form is that of a true creature of the night, with no trace of his original humanity remaining. He cannot disguise or cloak his shape; he is forever a monster. Having not seen sunlight in centuries, his pale, ghostly skin adds to his ghastly appearance, cementing his role as a lord of terror, moving unseen but never unmarked in the world of shadows. In his presence, there is a palpable, oppressive fear, the chilling reminder that he has forsaken all connection to his mortal origins.

**Motivations**: Barstow sees Mourn’s Folly as just another in a long line of secluded towns ripe for his particular form of domination and decay. His strategy is simple but effective: drain the town of its life and humanity, turning those he deems useful into feral vampires—soulless pawns driven by bloodlust to enforce his will. Any who prove especially loyal or cunning are kept as Thralls, tasked with managing his growing nests during daylight.

Through his agent, Marlon Voss, Barstow has begun to manipulate the town’s structures, securing his foothold while remaining unseen. Each hollowed-out home, each broken life, feeds his twisted empire, which he constructs from the shadows with an endless patience honed over centuries. To Barstow, Mourn’s Folly is just a temporary stronghold in an endless campaign. Once the town is drained and stripped of value, he will leave it in ruin, his feral minions lingering in empty houses as he moves on to his next victimized settlement. For over a hundred years, he has prowled the edges of civilization in this way, his ambition one of unceasing hunger and spreading darkness.

**Personality**: Barstow is a cold and merciless predator, a master of manipulation who preys on Mourn’s Folly from the shadows. Never seen in public, he prowls the town by night, selecting victims with calculated precision to satisfy his hunger and expand his influence. His presence is like a silent plague, spreading his dark will through carefully chosen thralls and feral vampires to guard his nests and cement his control. Every life is merely a resource, exploited or discarded without hesitation. Though he may appear only in fleeting glimpses beneath the moonlight, his influence over Mournstead Folly is a chilling, unyielding force—a haunting reminder of the absolute dominion he wields from the shadows.

## The History of Walter Barstow, Lord of Flies

Walter Barstow was born in a distant land, the sole heir to a fading line of nobility. From an early age, his fascination with the boundaries of life and death overshadowed the responsibilities of his bloodline. Traveling across lands steeped in mystery and old magic, Barstow eventually encountered a being older than any civilization—a creature of eternal darkness and incomprehensible malice. This being offered him what he sought: not just the mysteries of life and death, but mastery over them.

Barstow accepted, and in a ritual seared into his soul, he was transformed, becoming something far worse than human. His once-warm flesh grew cold, his humanity traded for an insatiable hunger and powers that twisted the very air around him. No longer bound to the life he once knew, he took to wandering, a shadow among men, perfecting his methods of manipulation and survival with each passing century. He learned to mask his monstrous nature, adopting new titles as his legend grew, each one carrying the weight of fear and despair that followed him.

As Barstow spread his influence across countless forgotten towns, his infamy grew, and so did the legends surrounding him. He became known as the **Lord of Flies** not only for his association with decay but because entire towns fell silent in his wake, the only signs of life being the scavenging insects drawn to the death he left behind. The title “**Hollowed One**” followed him as he drained towns of their humanity, leaving communities intact but hollow, their souls extinguished under his calculated, parasitic grasp. He was whispered as the **Bearer of Shadows**, for his presence was felt as a creeping doom long before he was seen, casting a dark pall over the lives of those he would soon enslave.

Barstow’s approach to control was unlike that of most vampires; he didn't crave chaos but calculated fear. Where other vampires amassed allies and underlings, he saw his kin as competition and stripped them of their humanity, transforming only a few into obedient, feral thralls whose loyalty and hunger bound them to his service. These feral vampires act as his front line, protecting him while he remains hidden, watching his plans unfold from the shadows.

Walter Barstow’s mastery over fear and his calculated ruthlessness have enabled him to remain hidden in plain sight, a specter woven into the fabric of local legends and whispered fears. He lingers on the fringes of humanity, moving from town to town, each place leaving fewer to tell of his horrors. For him, mortals are little more than pawns, and he regards life itself as a resource to be exploited, drained, and discarded. With his feral thralls and controlled whispers of dread, Barstow’s legacy continues to grow in shadow.

To those unfortunate enough to encounter him, he is more than just a vampire—he is the embodiment of despair, a dark figure whose path of ruin stretches back through forgotten ages. Each new settlement he invades is left broken, its people reduced to empty shells or ravenous monsters. Barstow’s calculated patience, his methodical transformation of the world around him, and his insidious web of influence make him one of the deadliest threats to those who unwittingly invite him into their lives. And as his dark purpose drives him onward, the legends of the **Lord of Flies** only grow darker, hinting at a power yet to be fully unleashed.
