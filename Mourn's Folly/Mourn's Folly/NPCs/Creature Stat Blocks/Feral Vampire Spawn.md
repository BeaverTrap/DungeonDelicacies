#### **Traits**

- **Blood Frenzy.** The feral vampire has advantage on melee attack rolls against any creature that doesn’t have all its hit points.

- **Regeneration.** The feral vampire regains 5 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point and isn’t in sunlight. If the feral vampire takes radiant damage or damage from holy water, this trait doesn’t function at the start of the feral vampire’s next turn.

- **Sunlight Sensitivity.** While in sunlight, the feral vampire has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks. It takes 10 radiant damage at the start of each turn it begins in direct sunlight.

- **Spider Climb.** The feral vampire can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

#### **Actions**

- **Multiattack.** The feral vampire makes two attacks: one with its claws and one with its bite.

- **Claws.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 7 (1d8 + 3) slashing damage. Instead of dealing damage, the vampire can grapple the target (escape DC 13).

- **Bite.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one willing creature, or a creature that is grappled by the vampire, incapacitated, or restrained. _Hit:_ 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) necrotic damage. The target’s hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and the vampire regains hit points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.

#### Vampire **Weaknesses**

The vampire has the following flaws:

- _Forbiddance._ The vampire can't enter a residence without an invitation from one of the occupants.

- _Harmed by Running Water._ The vampire takes 20 acid damage when it ends its turn in running water.

- _Stake to the Heart._ The vampire is destroyed if a piercing weapon made of wood is driven into its heart while it is [incapacitated](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) in its resting place.

- _Sunlight Hypersensitivity._ The vampire takes 20 radiant damage when it starts its turn in sunlight. While in sunlight, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.

- **Holy Symbols and Radiant Trinkets.** When a holy symbol or radiant trinket is presented within 10 feet of the feral vampire, it must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be repelled for 1 round.

### **Feral Vampire Traits**

- **Uncontrolled Hunger:** Newly turned vampires are overwhelmed by a ravenous craving for blood, and many of their actions are driven by this primal hunger. They have difficulty resisting the urge to feed, often lurking on the outskirts of town or preying on weaker, isolated townsfolk.

- **Increased Physical Abilities:** Although they lack refinement, feral vampires have heightened strength, speed, and senses. They can see well in the dark and can track potential prey by scent and sound.

- **Reduced Mental Control:** Young and inexperienced, feral vampires are prone to making noise, appearing visibly distressed, and struggling to control their movements. They’re more likely to lunge at a source of fresh blood, even if it reveals their presence.

- **Avoidance of Sunlight:** Direct sunlight is deadly to feral vampires, causing them to avoid the outdoors during the day and take refuge in dark, abandoned places. They may hide in attics, basements, or the mansion’s undercroft, using any available dark spaces as makeshift lairs.

- **Loyalty to Barstow:** As their progenitor, Barstow holds sway over them, and he can summon or command them. Although they lack the intelligence to strategize, they respond to Barstow’s calls and attempt to follow his instructions, particularly when targeting PCs or disrupting investigations.

### **Feral Vampire Behavior in Combat**

- **Reckless Attacks:** Driven by hunger, feral vampires are likely to engage in melee, lunging for necks and arms to bite. They prefer to overwhelm single targets, but their lack of coordination makes them relatively easy to lure or bait.

- **Weakness to Radiant Attacks:** Any radiant effects, such as those from clerics or paladins, are especially effective, causing them to flinch or cower. Holy symbols or radiant trinkets may even repel them briefly.

- **Lack of Self-Preservation:** Feral vampires rarely retreat; they’re more likely to fight to the death, though they might flee if Barstow directly commands it. This makes them dangerous but also relatively predictable foes, as they rush toward prey without regard for their own safety.
