#### **Traits**

- **Undead Fortitude.** If damage reduces the thrall to 0 hit points, it can make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the thrall drops to 1 hit point instead.

---

#### **Actions**

- **Grasping Bite.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.  
    _Hit:_ 5 (1d6 + 1) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a **DC 13 Strength saving throw** or be grappled by the "Zombie" Spawn (escape DC 13). While grappled in this way, the target is restrained, and the Spawn can use its **Feeding Frenzy** attack on its subsequent turns.

- **Feeding Frenzy.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ Automatically hits a creature grappled by the "Zombie" Spawn.  
    _Hit:_ 4 (1d4 + 2) necrotic damage, and the target’s hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.

##### **Mechanics in Play**

1. **Grasping Bite** initiates both a bite attack and a grapple if the target fails the saving throw, representing the spawn’s latching bite and insatiable hunger.

2. Once grappled, the Zombie Vampire Spawn can continue feeding on the target with **Feeding Frenzy** each round, automatically dealing damage and reducing the target’s maximum hit points, simulating the horror of a creature feeding while the victim is restrained.

##### **Behavior in Combat**

1. **Relentless Focus**: Once a "Zombie" Spawn has latched onto a victim with **Grasping Bite**, it will continue using **Feeding Frenzy** on that victim every turn, ignoring other creatures and attacks around it unless it is forcibly removed or the victim is drained.

2. **Forcibly Removing the Spawn**: Another creature can attempt to free the victim by using an action to make a successful **Strength (Athletics) check** (DC 13) to pull the spawn away. Alternatively, dealing enough damage to the spawn might break its focus, though it will still attempt to re-latch onto the nearest available target immediately.

These "Zombie" Vampires are slow and lack the power or intelligence of true vampires, acting more like thralls with an insatiable hunger. They’re unsettlingly zombie-like in both movement and instinct, adding to the PCs' confusion about the nature of the threat.

## **"Zombie" Spawn Decisive Defeat Conditions**

this emphasizes the vampire's vulnerabilities in non-combat or limited combat scenarios.

### **Prolonged Sunlight Exposure**

- **Effect**: Extended exposure to direct sunlight is fatal to "Zombie" Vampire Spawns.

- **Outcome**: After **3 consecutive rounds** (18 seconds) of direct sunlight exposure, they ignite, quickly turning to ash. A few seconds in direct sunlight leaves them unable to continue fighting or flee effectively.

### **Stake to the Heart**

- **Condition**: The Feral Vampire must be **incapacitated, restrained, or unconscious**.

- **Action**: Any creature within melee range can use an **action** to attempt to stake the vampire.

- **Tools**: Using a hammer to drive a wooden stake grants a **+5 bonus to the attack roll**, increasing the likelihood of successfully piercing the vampire’s heart.

- **Outcome on Success**:
    
    - If the attack succeeds, the spawn **explodes in a spray of blood and tissue**, with only the wooden stake remaining in the center of the blood-soaked remnants, a gruesome end fitting their corrupted nature. 

## **"Zombie" Spawn Behavior**

Zombie Vampire Spawns are creatures of unbridled, single-minded hunger. With no trace of their former selves, they’re driven purely by an instinct to feed. Once they’ve targeted a victim, they become fixated, blocking out everything else around them in a horrifying display of relentless aggression. These spawns move slowly but with a predatory intensity, often lunging clumsily at the nearest creature, their empty eyes locked onto fresh prey.

Upon grappling a victim with their **Grasping Bite**, the Zombie Spawn behaves like a frenzied animal, tearing and gnawing with an insatiable thirst. They cling tightly, making disturbing, guttural noises as they consume, entirely indifferent to pain or other threats. Only extreme force can pry them from their victim, and even then, their hunger drives them to latch onto any nearby creature immediately.

If a spawn is finally forced to let go or loses its target, it will pivot toward the next source of fresh blood with disturbing speed. Even when reduced to near defeat, the spawns show no instinct for self-preservation, throwing themselves at foes with a suicidal desperation. These undead predators will not cease until either they—or their unfortunate victim—are dead.

### **"Zombie" Spawn Description**

"Zombie" Spawns are deceptive, brutal creatures, usually crafted in haste by a weakened vampire. Though they are indeed vampires, their mindless aggression, vacant stares, and crude movements resemble a zombie's far more than a vampire’s calculated predation. They exist as a cruel ruse to mask their true nature, forcing those who encounter them to mistake them for common zombies.

"Zombie" Spawns bear no fangs and have none of the elegance associated with true vampires. Instead, they retain a disturbing resemblance to their former selves—pale, lifeless, and unmistakably dead. They lack the subtle predatory features of vampires, and their mouths are filled with broken, blunted teeth that tear through flesh rather than pierce it.

The appearance of each spawn varies depending on its “lineage” within this twisted infection. Those bitten directly by a true vampire tend to look less ravaged, while spawns created by other "Zombie" Spawns are often more battered and disfigured. Torn, jagged skin and gashes are visible on these second-generation spawns, evidence of the physical toll taken in their transformation.

With vacant, glassy eyes and skin that hangs like tattered cloth, these creatures move as shells of their former selves, seeming just “human” enough to be unsettling. Their undead hunger drives them to assault prey without finesse, gnawing with sheer force rather than precision. This savage feeding style leaves their victims scarred and dismembered, further adding to the mistaken belief that these are mindless zombies rather than the spawn of a vampire.
