### **Lemuel 'Lem' Brack**

**Role**: Town Carpenter and Woodworker  
**Personality**: Honest, unhurried, and a little rough around the edges. Lem’s practical nature is balanced by a surprisingly gentle care for his craft, and he’s known for his sharp eye and steady hand.  
**Background**: Lem was born and raised in Mourn’s Folly, learning carpentry from his father and grandfather. Known for his skill in fine woodworking, he’s created many of the structures and fixtures around town. While he prefers solitude, he’s always willing to lend a hand if asked.

**Routine**: Lem spends most of his days at his workshop, either repairing tools and furniture or crafting custom pieces for residents. He’s wary of Voss and Barstow but keeps his opinions close, prioritizing the quality of his work over gossip.

**Connection to Plot**: Voss recently commissioned Lem for specialized woodwork to restore Mournstead Manor’s interior. Lem is somewhat suspicious of the newcomers, noticing odd requests for hidden compartments and reinforced doors, but hasn’t voiced his concerns.
