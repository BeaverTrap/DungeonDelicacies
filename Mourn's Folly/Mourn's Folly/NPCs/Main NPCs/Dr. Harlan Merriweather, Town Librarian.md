- _"Knowledge is like a river; it flows through generations. We just have to know where to dip our cup."_
- _"If you’re interested in the mansion, well... it’s best to be cautious. History, you see, has a way of trapping the unwary."_
- _"The Folly’s a quiet place, but you’d be surprised at the mysteries hidden here, just beneath the surface."_

**Role:** Caretaker of Mourn’s Folly’s historical records and archives

**Personality:** Quiet, meticulous, and deeply curious. Dr. Merriweather is known for her somewhat reclusive nature, often absorbed in her books and scrolls, with an intense focus on preserving every detail of the town’s history.

**Background:** Merriweather has spent her entire life in Mourn’s Folly, becoming a fixture of the town’s library. She holds a vast knowledge of the Mournstead family and prides herself on being the authority on local lore. Her fascination with Mournstead Manor borders on obsession, yet most townsfolk view her dedication as a charming, if eccentric, quirk.

**Routine:** Merriweather can often be found in the dim, dusty corners of the town’s small library, organizing archives or poring over historical accounts. She emerges on occasion to share stories with younger townsfolk or entertain curious patrons at the tavern. Though usually shy, she lights up when discussing Mournstead history.

**Connection to Plot:** The restoration of Mournstead Manor has piqued her scholarly interest, seeing it as a rare opportunity to fill in the gaps in her research. If the PCs approach her, she’s eager to share her knowledge of the mansion’s history, family lineage, and lore—though she might not fully grasp the darker implications of what she knows.
