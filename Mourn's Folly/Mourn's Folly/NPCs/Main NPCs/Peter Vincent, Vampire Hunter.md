#### **Traits**

- **Silver-Tongued**: Peter has advantage on Persuasion checks to convince others of his knowledge or competence in vampire hunting.

- **Undead Lore**: Due to his experience, Peter has advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks related to undead, particularly vampires. He also has advantage on Wisdom (Insight) checks to detect vampire behavior.

- **Spellcasting.** Peter is a 5th-level spellcaster. His spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 14, +6 to hit with spell attacks). He has the following spells prepared:
    
    - **Cantrips (at will):** _Light_, _Vicious Mockery_
    - **1st level (4 slots):** _Faerie Fire_, _Healing Word_, _Heroism_

#### **Actions**

- **Rapier.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 7 (1d8 + 2) piercing damage.
    
- **Crossbow.** _Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +4 to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 6 (1d8 + 2) piercing damage.

---

**Reactions**

- **Cutting Words.** When a creature Peter can see within 60 feet makes an attack roll, ability check, or damage roll, Peter can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration to reduce the result by 1d8, potentially causing a miss or failure.

*Peter’s theatrical style and old stage props may bring humor, but his genuine commitment to vampire hunting makes him a surprising asset. His dramatic flair keeps him grounded in his past while proving to the PCs that sometimes, heroes come from unexpected places.*

### **Peter Vincent, Vampire Hunter Extraordinaire**

- **Role**: Former stage actor, now self-proclaimed "Vampire Hunter."
    
- **Personality**:
    
    - Flamboyant, theatrical, and quick to embellish, Peter’s confidence often masks his insecurities. Known for his grand gestures and flair, he’s charmingly self-assured but occasionally stumbles in genuinely dangerous situations. Though once a skeptic, his brush with real vampires has left him both horrified and resolute in his new calling. He sometimes still slips into “performance mode,” his bravado shining through even in the heat of battle.
	
	- **Background**: Known for his theatrical performances and rich singing voice, Peter Vincent once made a modest name for himself in live theater. His most popular acts involved thrilling tales of the supernatural, where he portrayed vampire hunters and demon slayers on stage. Little did he know his dramatizations would one day align with his real calling. An unexpected encounter with a vampire turned his life around, and Peter now roams with a genuine purpose: hunting down the undead.
    
	- **Connection to Plot**: Peter arrives in Mourn’s Folly in the later acts, likely Act 3, when Barstow’s influence is near its peak. His flamboyant personality, coupled with his theatrical knowledge of supernatural creatures, makes him a curious stranger, but his bardic talents and actual knowledge of vampires quickly prove his worth. Though the townsfolk may see him as an outsider, Peter can offer the PCs insights and spells that bolster their chances against Barstow’s thralls.
    
	- **Role as a Bardic Ally**: Using bardic magic, Peter aids the PCs by inspiring courage, supporting their defenses, and casting light-based spells to repel the undead. His songs, laced with hints of his encounters with the supernatural, serve as both strategy and rallying cries. Peter’s access to useful spells, like _Faerie Fire_ to reveal hidden foes or _Dispel Magic_ to remove dark curses, adds versatility to the party’s tactics against Barstow.

#### **Peter Vincent’s Gear and Skills**

- **Weapon**: _Crossbow of the Undead’s Bane_
    
    - A prop from his old theater days, enchanted after his run-in with a real vampire. Deals an additional 1d4 radiant damage to undead, with a +1 bonus to hit.
- **Gadget**: _Sunburst Powder_
    
    - Originally used for dramatic effects on stage, this powder can briefly mimic sunlight, creating a 10-foot sphere of dim light for one round. Undead in the area have disadvantage on attacks and saving throws.
