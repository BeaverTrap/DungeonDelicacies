- **Trope:** A local farmer whose family has worked the same land for generations, they embody the values of hard work, self-sufficiency, and loyalty to their roots. Growing up in the fields, they know the rhythms of nature better than anyone, and their no-nonsense, practical attitude makes them a respected figure in _Mourn’s Folly_. They don’t put much stock in gossip or idle talk, preferring to focus on their duties and tending to their land. But the recent restoration of the old mansion has disturbed something in them—a feeling that the balance of the land may be shifting. Though they rarely give in to superstition, they can’t shake the sense that something unnatural may be creeping back into their town, and they quietly vow to keep an eye on things, ready to protect their home if need be.
