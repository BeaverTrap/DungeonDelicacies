- **Trope:** As one of _Mourn’s Folly’s_ Veilwardens, they protect the wilderness surrounding the town, ensuring that a vigilant eye is always on the borderlands. Rotating with another Veilwarden to keep a constant presence at the outpost, they spend three months on duty in the deep woods, followed by one month of shore-leave in town. Though technically off-duty during this time, they carry themselves with authority, especially in matters concerning the wild lands they watch over. They take pride in their role and are quick to step in when disturbances arise, even on shore-leave. With the recent stir around the mansion and the influx of strangers near the woods, they remain alert, sensing that these changes may disrupt the natural balance they’re sworn to protect.
