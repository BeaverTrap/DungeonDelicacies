- **Trope:** A former soldier and recent arrival to _Mourn’s Folly_, they’ve quietly settled in over the past few months, hoping to uncover a hidden piece of their family’s history. Secretly the last descendant of Edgar Mournstead, they feel a strong connection to their ancestor, who, like them, led a life of service before seeking peace in the small town. This personal bond drives their desire to claim the Mournstead legacy, though, without proof of their lineage, it remains a private mission. Initially, the locals were hesitant to warm up to the newcomer, but with time, they’ve come to respect the soldier’s steady presence and practical nature. They’ve been subtly searching for a way to explore the manor to find evidence of their heritage. However, with Voss and Barstow’s recent purchase of the property, they fear they may have missed their chance. Even so, they remain quietly hopeful, keeping their heritage a closely guarded secret while navigating the town’s social fabric with purpose.
