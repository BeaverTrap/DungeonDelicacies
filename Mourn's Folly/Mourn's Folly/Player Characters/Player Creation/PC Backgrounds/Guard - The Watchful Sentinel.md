- **Trope:** As the town guard responsible for keeping the peace in _Mourn’s Folly_, they’re known for their strict but fair approach to law and order, always alert to any disturbances. A pillar of stability in this quiet community, they take pride in knowing every resident and ensuring the town remains safe and undisturbed. However, the recent influx of strangers and the commotion surrounding the mansion’s restoration have them on high alert. Used to handling only the occasional barroom scuffle or petty theft, they now feel a heightened sense of vigilance. With the town bustling in ways it hasn’t in years, they’re determined to watch over the community closely, prepared for anything that may come.
