	in Lathander’s light, looking up to Cedric as a guide and role model. But lately, they’ve seen unsettling cracks in his faith: Cedric’s once-confident sermons waver, his hands tremble during blessings, and his late-night drinks grow more frequent. These signs sow seeds of doubt in the disciple's heart, making them wonder if their own faith is strong enough to withstand the weight of responsibility. Yet, feeling a deep sense of duty, they quietly take on more tasks around the shrine, hoping to ease Cedric’s burden and rekindle his faith. In their private moments, they question whether they are ready for the challenges they see coming, all the while praying for the strength to stand firm in a town that needs them now more than ever.
