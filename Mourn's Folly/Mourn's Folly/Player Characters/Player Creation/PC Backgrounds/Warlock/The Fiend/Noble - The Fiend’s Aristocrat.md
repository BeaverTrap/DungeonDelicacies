- **Description:** Born into a once-prominent family that quietly governs _Mourn’s Folly_, they made a pact with a Fiend to secure their family’s legacy and elevate their influence in a changing world. With the arrival of Marlon Voss and the restoration of the old mansion, they see a chance to reclaim their family's former glory. Drawing strength from their infernal patron, they wield power with cunning and poise, subtly manipulating situations to uphold their family’s name. While the townsfolk respect them, there’s an undercurrent of wariness as they navigate the fine line between ambition and danger, all while plotting to ensure their family’s position remains unchallenged.

**Note:** If a player character (PC) is using the **Noble - The Fallen Heir** background, then they are the older sibling or cousin of the **The Fiend’s Aristocrat**. This connection can create rich storytelling opportunities and family dynamics within _Mourn’s Folly_.
