- **Description:** Once known as the town’s resident troublemaker, they’ve always flirted with danger, but their life of petty crime took a dark turn after discovering a relic hidden away in an old, forgotten corner of _Mourn’s Folly_. When they touched it, a bargain was forged with a powerful fiend from the Lower Planes, granting them supernatural powers at the cost of unknown favors to come. Since then, they’ve sensed the fiend’s influence during moments of temptation, pushing them toward actions that stir up trouble around town. Marlon Voss’s arrival has piqued their curiosity; something about Voss’s secrets and the mansion’s renovations feels like an invitation for mischief—and they know their patron wouldn’t mind if they stirred up a bit of chaos to uncover the truth.
