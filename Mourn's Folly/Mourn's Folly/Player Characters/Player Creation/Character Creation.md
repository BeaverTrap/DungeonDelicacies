### Step 1: Choose a Background

### Step 2: Select a Class

- **All classes in the 2024 PHB are available**.
- Align your class with your background and the suggested options if you want a character that balances well with their story role and skillset.
- Starting at **level 5**, you’ll have powerful class abilities, spells, and Extra Attack if your class provides it at this level.

### Step 3: Ability Scores – 27-Point Buy

- Use the **27-point buy system** to set your character’s ability scores.
- Points are spent according to the table below:

|Score|Point Cost|
|---|---|
|8|0|
|9|1|
|10|2|
|11|3|
|12|4|
|13|5|
|14|7|
|15|9|

- **Maximum Starting Stat** is 15 (before racial/background bonuses).
- This lets you prioritize key abilities (such as Strength for Fighters, Charisma for Sorcerers, etc.) while balancing out your secondary stats.

### Step 4: Equipment & Starting Wealth

- Each character begins with **250 gold pieces** to purchase equipment and supplies.
- Choose from **standard gear** from the 2024 PHB.


### Step 5: Choose Spells (for Spellcasters)

- Select spells available for your class up to **3rd level** spells.
- Focus on spells that complement your background and character role (for example, a Bard with a performer background might favor spells that charm or influence).

### Step 6: Bring Your Backstory and Faith to Life

- **Integrate Your Background**: Reflect on how your character’s background and role in **Mourn’s Folly** connect to the unfolding story. Consider ties to the town’s history, relationships with its residents, or intrigue regarding the new arrivals and recent events.

- **Deity and Faith**:
    
    - **Symbolic Trinkets**: If your character follows a deity, they may carry a **trinket bearing their deity's symbol**. This item embodies their devotion and adds depth to role-playing moments.
    - **Divine Influence in Dark Moments**: For characters devoted to deities of **light, protection, dawn, or life**—such as _Lathander, Pelor, or Selûne_—the trinket may hold a rare ability to **repel dark or unsettling presences** during moments of profound faith. This effect would be at the DM's discretion, requiring a significant act of devotion or deep faith, with limited and specific use.
    - **Other Deities**: For characters whose deities align with **neutral or darker domains**—such as trickery, war, knowledge, or death—the trinket may not affect unnatural forces directly but can still hold other symbolic or situational significance.

### Step 7: Final Touches

- Record your **AC, hit points, speed, and saving throws**.
- Choose **feats or ability score increases** if applicable for level 5.
- Equip your character with any personal items, trinkets, or notes related to their background for a more immersive experience.
