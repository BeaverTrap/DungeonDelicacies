For your characters at level 5, we’re using the **27-point buy** system to customize ability scores. This approach gives you flexibility to shape your character's strengths and weaknesses while keeping things balanced for the campaign.

### How the 27-Point Buy System Works

| Score | Point Cost |
| ----- | ---------- |
| 8     | 0          |
| 9     | 1          |
| 10    | 2          |
| 11    | 3          |
| 12    | 4          |
| 13    | 5          |
| 14    | 7          |
| 15    | 9          |

- **Maximum Starting Stat**: 15 (before adding any racial or background bonuses).
- **Minimum Starting Stat**: 8 (no cost to take this value).

With this system, you have **27 points to spend** on your character’s ability scores, balancing high scores in key areas with the need to stay within the budget. This means you can prioritize your main stats based on your class and background needs while maintaining a well-rounded character. For example, if you're a Fighter, you might invest in Strength and Constitution, while a Bard may focus on Charisma and Dexterity.

### Why Use the 27-Point Buy at Level 5?

Even though you’re starting at level 5, the **27-point buy remains a solid choice** because your character's power boost comes from their class abilities, spells, and extra attacks—not just raw ability scores. At this level, you’ll have stronger class features and possibly more equipment, making your character feel powerful without needing super high starting stats. Additionally, as you progress, magic items, feats, and ability score increases will let you grow even further.

This setup helps create balance, keeps room for growth, and gives you a fun starting point with customization to bring out your character’s strengths and quirks.
