Act 1
- Introduction
- [[1b - Alternative Start (Sailor Background)]]
	- **The Lost Sailor**
    
    - **Event**: A new sailor mysteriously disappears overboard during the night, leaving only a splash as a clue. This disappearance creates a sense of foreboding and suspicion among the crew.
    
    - **Impact on PCs**: PCs with a **Sailor** background (or those connected to the river trade) will sense the unusual nature of the disappearance. The incident is kept low-key, as the captain is focused on keeping the schedule, but the crew remains unsettled.
    
- **Unease on Board**
    
    - **Event**: After the sailor’s disappearance, some crew members feel an inexplicable reluctance around certain crates, particularly one that is large and tightly sealed. A sense of unease settles, though the captain reassures the crew, dismissing superstitions.
    
    - **Impact on PCs**: This is an opportunity to introduce a subtle awareness that the shipment isn’t entirely normal. PCs connected to the event may feel drawn to investigate the large crate, though they find it locked and impenetrable.
	
- **Arrival in Mourn’s Folly**
    
    - **Event**: Upon arrival, the PCs see **Marlon Voss** waiting at the dock to personally oversee the unloading of his shipment. Impeccably dressed, he watches closely as each item is removed and directs the largest crate immediately to his shop’s cellar, ensuring it remains secure and away from prying eyes.
    
    - **Impact on PCs**: Voss’s meticulous attention to the large crate and his refusal to let anyone else handle it suggests something significant—and suspicious. This sets Voss as an early figure of mistrust and intrigue, especially for PCs connected to the shipment.
    
- [[1a - Start - Arrival and Suspicion]]a

- **Exploration and Social Interaction**
    
    - **Event**: PCs engage with townsfolk to learn about Mournstead Mansion’s haunted reputation and hear about Edgar Mournstead’s tragic history.
    - **Impact on PCs**: These interactions give PCs insight into the town’s superstitions, local lore, and history, setting up a foundation of mystery and distrust around the mansion.
	
- **Foreshadowing of Darkness**
    
    - **Event**: Locals mention unusual happenings at the mansion—strange sounds, “haunted” rumors, and accidents during renovation. Voss’s own evasiveness about Barstow’s absence adds to the ominous atmosphere.
    - **Impact on PCs**: This builds a sense of unease, with PCs becoming more suspicious of Voss, Barstow, and their motives. The mansion is painted as both intriguing and dangerous.
	
- **Encounters with Voss**
    
    - **Event**: PCs may meet Voss in his antique shop or around town. Voss is charming but avoids direct answers about Barstow and minimizes the mansion’s lore.
    - **Impact on PCs**: This encounter sets Voss as a central, mysterious figure and reinforces a sense of hidden agendas. The PCs may feel that there’s more going on than Voss is letting on.

### **Daytime Exploration and Rumors**

**Overview**: During the first day, the PCs are free to explore Mourn’s Folly, gathering supplies and interacting with the locals. As they ask questions, they’ll uncover rumors about the mansion, Voss, and Barstow, heightening the intrigue and giving them leads to follow.

**Key Rumors to Discover**:

- **The Haunted Mansion**
    
    - **“Cursed Estate”**: Locals call Mournstead Mansion cursed, warning others to avoid it after dark. They speak of Edgar’s ghost still mourning his lost family and claim strange voices or figures are occasionally glimpsed from the windows.
	
- **Voss’s Unusual Presence**
    
    - **“That Charming Outsider”**: Voss is known for his charm but has a habit of evading questions about his past. His shipments are a subject of town talk, with locals noting how particular he is about certain items going directly to the mansion’s cellar.
	
- **The Mystery of Barstow**
    
    - **“The Absent Business Partner”**: Voss speaks highly of Barstow, though no one has actually seen him. Voss’s explanations about his partner’s absence are vague, and rumors circulate that Barstow has an unusual interest in dark artifacts.
	
- **Additional Town Gossip**
    
    - **Accidents at the Manor**: Workers on the mansion’s restoration have encountered sudden chills, missing tools, and minor injuries without clear cause. Some claim these are signs of the mansion’s “cursed” aura.
    
    - **Edgar Mournstead’s Legacy**: Older residents share Edgar Mournstead’s story, believing the dark history ties to why the mansion exudes an unsettling presence. Some suggest that Barstow’s interest in the mansion might go deeper than simple investment.

### Encouraging Preparations

- **Supplies and Gear**: PCs have a chance to stock up on lanterns, ropes, holy symbols, and local trinkets before nightfall. Characters who dig deeper into rumors may even receive advice from Father Cedric on charms or symbols for “protection.”

### The Crate’s Mysterious Delivery

**Event**: After sunset, a delivery ship arrives with cargo for Mourn’s Folly. Voss pays the crew extra to take a particularly large, mysterious crate directly to the mansion’s cellar instead of his shop. The PCs can observe, follow, or even investigate, adding an element of stealth and curiosity.
	
- 6 pm Delivery
	- Delivery ship arrives at river dock
	- the townsfolk are told of the missing shipmate that had disappeared overboard in the night from the crew as they unload the delivery
	- Voss is there overseeing the delivery of items to the shop
	- when at the Shop Voss instructs the 2 delivery men to the manor with the large crate, PC may overhear this if they are watching Voss closely
	- as the cart starts off to delever the crate towrds the manor a commotion in the town square is hears, the "Diversion Scenario" starts - the "Undead" Sailor Returns

from here the story could deviate, the group could:

help the rest of the towns folk who are starting to be attacked by the "Zombie" vampires
or
follow the cart, or try and stop the cart, leading them up to the manor

either way both events will happen, it just depends on the choice of the party as how the next phase unfolds.
