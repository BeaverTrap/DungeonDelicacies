(Back to [[Mournstead Folly]])

 **Owner**: [[Ethelwyn Cott, General Store Owner]]

**Location**: Perched on a slight hill overlooking **Mourn’s Folly**, the manor is a sprawling, eerie estate that can be seen from almost anywhere in town. Surrounded by thick woods on one side and a stone wall on the other, it’s both removed from and omnipresent in the town's life.

**Exterior Description**:

> **Mournstead Manor looms on the hill, its stone facade weathered and darkened with age. Ivy snakes up the walls, clinging stubbornly to crumbling stonework and creeping around cracked window frames. The once-grand estate is surrounded by wrought-iron fencing, now rusted and broken in places, lending a further air of decay to the estate. Despite recent renovations, portions of the roof remain visibly damaged, and wooden shutters creak loosely in the wind, their original paint faded to a dull grey-green. A winding, overgrown path leads from a pair of iron gates up to the front entrance, where a set of stone steps, lined with chipped carvings, beckon reluctantly.**

**Interior (Ground Floor)**:

> **Inside, the air is stale and damp, carrying the faint smell of aged wood and lingering dust. A grand staircase dominates the entry hall, its banister recently polished but the steps creaking underfoot. Faded portraits hang along the walls, their subjects watching with blank, knowing stares. Flickering candle sconces cast weak pools of light, adding to the pervasive feeling of gloom. An elaborate parlor room extends to the left, filled with dust-covered furniture draped in white cloths, while a dimly lit dining room opens on the right. Recently unpacked crates, some marked with arcane symbols, line the walls, hinting at recent activity but failing to counteract the weight of years within these walls.**

**Basement/Cellar Entrance**:

> **In the back of the house, hidden behind an old bookshelf and accessed via a small, unobtrusive door, lies the stairway leading down to the cellar. The wooden steps creak underfoot, and the descent feels colder with each step. This cellar has seen some recent use; fresh scratches scar the floor near a large, padlocked crate, and strange symbols have been painted on the stone walls, their meaning obscured to all but the most knowledgeable in the occult. An iron door at the end of the hall is reinforced with heavy, tarnished locks.**

### **Key Locations within Mournstead Manor**

1. **[[The Parlor]]**
    
    - A large, musty room filled with antique furniture, the parlor seems preserved in time. Dust-covered cloths drape over chairs, and a grand piano sits untouched in one corner. A tall bookcase, partially filled with dusty tomes, hides the entrance to the cellar.
    
2. **[[The Dining Room]]**
    
    - The long, grand table is covered in a decaying tablecloth, remnants of long-gone meals still staining its fabric. Recently, the room has been filled with crates and boxes, left unopened and labeled in cryptic handwriting. The old candelabra casts eerie shadows, illuminating just enough to suggest activity yet leaving much to the imagination.
    
3. **[[The Cellar]]**
    
    - The cellar is dark and oppressive, with the unmistakable smell of damp stone. Alongside a few wine racks and empty shelves, a large, reinforced crate sits near the stairs, and several smaller containers line the walls. Strange symbols have been painted on the walls, and the floor bears scratch marks as if something has been recently dragged. The room is cold, uncomfortably so, with an aura that feels ancient and almost alive.
    
4. **[[The Library]]**
    
    - A smaller, hidden library on the upper floor contains books on a variety of subjects, with several volumes covering occult topics, local legends, and the Mournstead family’s history. The windows are permanently latched shut, with faint symbols etched into the glass. It’s here that the town’s darkest stories may reside, holding secrets to the manor’s ominous past.
    
5. **[[The Upstairs Rooms]]**
    
    - The second floor is lined with a series of bedrooms, all eerily silent and filled with furniture covered in dust and cobwebs. Each room has the same untouched quality, suggesting no one has lived here for years. In some of the rooms, the windows are boarded, allowing in only narrow slivers of moonlight.

### **Atmosphere and Events**

- **Creeping Dread**: Every room carries a feeling of being watched. Strange whispers or light scratching sounds echo down halls or float just beyond sight.

- **Subtle Unsettling Details**: Portraits seem to follow guests, and reflections in mirrors sometimes show brief flickers of movement.

- **Occasional Paranormal Hints**: Doors close unexpectedly, small objects shift or fall, and shadows seem to elongate as the sun sets. Players staying here may begin to feel fatigue, as if drained by an unseen presence.
