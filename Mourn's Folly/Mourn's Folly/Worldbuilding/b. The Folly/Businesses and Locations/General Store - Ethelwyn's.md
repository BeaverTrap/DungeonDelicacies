### **Daytime Flavor Text:**

> As you step inside, the warmth and smell of dried spices and herbs greet you. Shelves are lined with jars of preserves, cloth sacks of grain, and rows of canned goods. To the right, a display table overflows with seasonal fruits, neatly stacked, while bundles of fresh vegetables hang from hooks along the back wall. The low hum of conversation fills the space as townsfolk exchange bits of gossip, some whispered over baskets of eggs or packets of dried tea.

> Ethelwyn is perched behind a well-worn wooden counter, keenly observing the flow of patrons. She offers a welcoming smile to each customer, quick to ask about their family or share the latest rumors. It’s clear that the store is as much a place for socializing as it is for shopping.

### **Nighttime Flavor Text:**

> The shop is dark, its windows casting only the faintest glow from the street’s lanterns outside. Through the glass, shadows dance over shelves packed with goods, the outlines of jars and baskets creating a dim tapestry of shapes in the silence. The faint smell of dried herbs lingers, mingling with a whisper of candle wax and old wood, remnants of the day’s bustling activity.

> If you’re able to slip inside, the silence is almost absolute, save for the occasional creak of a floorboard underfoot. Shelves feel closer, packed tightly with goods, and the beams from a lantern or candle cast long shadows across the walls. The small trinkets and jars seem to glow faintly in the dim light, adding an odd, eerie warmth to the cluttered space. Ethelwyn’s counter sits deserted, her ledger still open as if she had just stepped away, though the quiet suggests that any life has long since retreated.
