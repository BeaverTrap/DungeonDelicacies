(Back to [[Mournstead Folly]])

**Owner**: [[Marlon Voss]] and [[Walter Barstow]]

### **History**
Once an old trading post, the building had been a modest but lively part of Mourn’s Folly for generations, hosting a simple market where travelers and locals exchanged goods. However, over the years, its relevance faded, leaving it abandoned and gathering dust. The town saw it as a relic itself—until Voss and his mysterious partner acquired it, infusing new energy and intrigue into the location. Now, with renovations near completion, the shop stands as a renewed curiosity, almost ready for its grand opening.

**Description**:
The shop area is dimly lit, with shelves lined with peculiar, sometimes unsettling artifacts and relics. Odd curiosities and aged manuscripts are meticulously arranged for display, with each shelf casting elongated shadows that make it feel like the relics are part of a larger, unknown story. In the back, a storage area is packed tightly with crates, some labeled with destinations from distant lands, others unmarked, adding an aura of mystery.

### Interior Layout:

- **Main Showroom**: A carefully curated selection of rare items fills the room. Shelves display strange artifacts, peculiar charms, and magical objects, each with a faint aura or shimmer. Underneath glass cases, enchanted weapons are set beside ancient tomes, strange statuettes, and delicate jewelry that whispers of past lives.
- **Storage Area**: Situated at the back, this room is stacked with crates labeled with arcane symbols. Though most crates appear mundane, some give off a faint magical aura, hinting at the shop’s more mysterious inventory.
- **Security**: The shop is outfitted with sturdy locks and arcane wards, especially around the more valuable displays. At night, magical wards hum faintly around certain cases, adding an air of protection and caution.

### **Day 1: Pre-Grand Opening Setup**

> **As you step inside, the polished wood floors gleam under lantern light, and the air smells faintly of incense mixed with aged parchment. Workers unpack crates stamped with unknown symbols, carefully placing items onto polished shelves and within glass displays. Marlon Voss supervises, his attention on every detail, adjusting displays to perfection. “Gentle now, that’s a century-old elven relic,” he instructs, nodding approvingly.**
> 
> **The shop is only half-prepared, with boxes and open crates scattered about, but its mystery is already palpable. Display cases showcase a curious blend of enchanted weapons, strange amulets, rare stones, and curious artifacts from distant lands. A shimmering rapier rests beside a glass orb swirling with mist, and a dagger with runes sits near an ivory figurine carved with intricate symbols. Voss nods politely as you observe, his focus never wavering from his vision for the shop.**

### **Day 2: Grand Opening**

> **The shop is alive with energy as townsfolk wander through, eyes wide with wonder. Marlon Voss, gliding from display to display, points out unique items to curious patrons. “This ancient dwarven flask was carved from a single gem,” he explains, holding up a translucent, shimmering vessel. Artifacts and enchanted items are displayed with perfect lighting, making each piece gleam with allure.**
> 
> **The displays highlight an assortment of curiosities: a finely crafted +1 longsword beside a collection of rare elven rings, a dwarven greataxe set near strange metal charms, and a silver-bound tome inscribed with arcane glyphs. Voss’s charisma seems to charm the crowd, and though the prices are high, the townsfolk are mesmerized by the mystery and wonder of it all. The air buzzes with excitement as the townsfolk speculate about the shop’s unusual offerings and Voss’s distant partner, Barstow, whom no one has yet met.**

### **After-Hours: Breaking In**

> **Under the cover of night, the shop looms dark and quiet, its windows casting faint reflections of the moonlight. A skilled hand might bypass the heavy lock on the front door, though the interior hums with an aura of watchful stillness. Inside, shelves cast long shadows across the floor, and the glass cases seem to gleam faintly, guarding their secrets.**
> 
> **The room is filled with an odd assortment of items—some magical weapons, strange charms, and mysterious relics from unknown origins. In the back, the storage area is stacked with crates and boxes labeled “tools,” “decor,” or with cryptic runes. A soft magical hum resonates from the high-value items, as if the shop itself is keeping watch. Every creak of the floorboards seems louder in the stillness, adding to the tension of sneaking among the town’s most prized curios.**
