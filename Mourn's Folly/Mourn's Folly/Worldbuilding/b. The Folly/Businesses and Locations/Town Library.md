(Back to [[Mournstead Folly]])

**Librarian**: [[Dr. Harlan Merriweather, Town Librarian]]

## Library

**Library Hours:**
- **Monday to Friday:** 9 AM – 5 PM
- **Saturday:** 10 AM – 2 PM
- **Sunday:** Closed

- **Librarian**: Dr. Harlan Merriweather

>The library is a modest, one-room building nestled along the quiet main street, its exterior simple and unadorned aside from a faded wooden sign reading “Town Library.” Inside, the air is thick with the smell of old paper and leather bindings. Shelves are crammed with books, records, and documents detailing everything from agricultural practices to the town’s folklore. Dusty sunlight filters through narrow windows, casting warm hues over the worn wooden floor and giving the space a comforting, timeless feel. Dr. Merriweather meticulously preserves the town’s history here, sharing tales and obscure knowledge of Mournstead with any curious enough to ask. 
>Shelves are neatly labeled, and a small corner table with a couple of mismatched chairs offers a place for quiet reading. Most of the books are weathered, their covers softened with age, but they hold the stories and secrets of the Folly’s past, available to any who might seek them.

Dr. Harlan takes her role seriously, enforcing strict library policies and keeping careful track of all borrowed items. Anyone wishing to check out a book must apply for a library card, which involves a bit more than just signing up. Dr. Harlan requires individuals to prove their worthiness to handle the town’s historic texts.

## Library Card

**Library Card Application:**  
_Characters wishing to check out books must roll a Charisma or Intelligence-based skill check (DC 12)_ to make a strong enough impression on Dr. Harlan, demonstrating either respect for the library’s rules or genuine interest in the material. Success earns a temporary library card for their research, while failure results in restricted access, meaning they can only study books within the library under Dr. Harlan’s watchful eye.

**Resident Library Card Check:**

- _If your character is a resident_, they likely have a library card already, but it might not be on hand. Roll a DC 10 Luck check (D20) to determine if they have their library card with them:
    - **Success (10 or higher):** They have their card on them and can check out books freely.
	
    - **Failure (9 or lower):** They’ve misplaced their card, requiring them to either search the library under Dr. Harlan’s supervision or reapply by rolling a Charisma or Intelligence check (DC 12) as outlined for new applicants.

Dr. Harlan isn’t shy about reminding residents of their duty to keep their cards safe, so those who lose their cards too often may face a stern lecture on “responsibility toward the preservation of Mourn’s Folly’s knowledge.”

### Library Card Lecture

>"Your library card, dear resident, is not just a slip of paper. It is a **key to knowledge, a badge of trust, and a pledge to uphold the preservation of our town’s legacy.** Through these doors, history breathes. To neglect your card is to neglect your heritage, your duty, and the countless souls whose tales are bound within these walls.
>**Mourn’s Folly remembers those who remember it**—through their commitment to respect and safeguard the wisdom held here. Misplace it once, and it may be forgiven. Misplace it twice, and you may find yourself temporarily bound to these very shelves as a guardian of the tomes.
>So I ask you, as I ask all, please honor the privilege. Hold on to your card—reverently, responsibly, and with the knowledge that you, in turn, are holding on to the very heart of Mourn’s Folly."

Every resident knows that “Mourn’s Folly remembers those who remember it” is Dr. Harlan’s favorite phrase, uttered with a mix of reverence and a slight air of foreboding.

# Seeking Vampire Lore

*To seek specific information on the vampiric lore at the library, characters would need to approach Dr. Harlan or dig through the library archives themselves.*

### Option 1: Speaking with Dr. Harlan

**Challenge:** Convincing Dr. Harlan to disclose information or point them in the right direction.

- **Persuasion or Insight Check (DC 15):** Dr. Harlan is cautious by nature, not eager to spread tales that could stir the town’s fears. Characters will need to earn her trust or show genuine concern. Success convinces her to share her knowledge of _The Nocturne Codex_ and its descriptions of ancient, shadowy creatures.

- **Failure:** Dr. Harlan dismisses their inquiries as idle curiosity. A second attempt might require them to demonstrate the seriousness of the threat (perhaps with physical evidence or tales of strange happenings).

### Option 2: Searching the Library

**Challenge:** Locating the specific tome without Harlan’s guidance.

- **Investigation Check (DC 16):** Characters need to sort through centuries-old records, dusty scrolls, and outdated indexes to locate _The Nocturne Codex_ or similar sources. If successful, they find the codex hidden away in a neglected corner of the library.

- **Failure:** Characters waste time searching through irrelevant tomes, potentially drawing Dr. Harlan’s attention, who may then intervene and question their motives.

---

### Complications

1. **Dr. Harlan’s Suspicion:** If she finds characters searching without her consent, she may ask them to leave or even alert local guards, adding tension to the investigation.

2. **Unseen Eyes:** As word spreads of their inquiry into vampiric lore, Voss or other thralls might become aware and begin monitoring their activities, adding urgency to their investigation.


## Success

>In the dim back corner of Mournstead’s library, a particularly worn, leather-bound tome catches the eye, marked only by an ancient sigil faintly resembling a bat. Known simply as _The Nocturne Codex_, this text delves into the origins and weaknesses of vampiric creatures. It speaks of their aversion to sunlight, their vulnerability to holy symbols, and the power of running water as a barrier. The text also mentions "ancient rites of protection," and the potency of silver and radiant magic against them. For any who dare seek, the codex offers knowledge that few would wish to confront.

## excerpts from _The Nocturne Codex_:

> "The creature that shuns the light is cursed by the dawn; it finds no solace under the rising sun, for its powers wane and falter in daylight’s embrace. Beware, for in shadow and darkness, it moves as swift as a breath, unbound by mortal limits."

---

> "Of sacred symbols, let it be known: The vampiric kind recoil before holy relics not by mortal hand forged, but blessed by those who walk the path of the gods. For them, the faith of the living is a fire that scalds and repels."

---

> "Running water, pure and true, is a bane to the corrupted; they cannot cross streams or rivers of natural origin, lest their form be cast down into mist and driven away by its flow."

---

> "Silver, the moon's metal, holds sway over the undead; fashioned into blade or arrow, it pierces their defenses, drawing a wound that festers with radiant agony. Likewise, the light of divinity—radiant and searing—burns their unholy flesh."

---

> "Beware, for the power of the ancient undead lies not only in their strength but in their gaze, which compels obedience, and their bite, which binds the spirit to shadow. Trust not their words, for they are as slippery as smoke and as binding as shackles."
