**Owner/Editor**: [[Scribe - The Town Chronicler]]

### Mournstead Musings 
(*name can be changed to fit [[Scribe - The Town Chronicler]] PC personal backstory*)

- Inside, stacks of paper, quills, and printing supplies are scattered across worn wooden desks. The walls are decorated with past editions, each highlighting notable events from the town's history. Locals frequently stop by to drop off tips, share town happenings, or catch up on the latest stories.

- **Routine**: The editor, [[Scribe - The Town Chronicler]], a fervent chronicler of local events, spends hours gathering stories and rumors from Ethelwyn's General Store, the tavern, and townsfolk who pass by. Printing days are bustling, with copies quickly snatched up or distributed around the Folly.
