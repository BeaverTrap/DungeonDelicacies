**Caretaker**: [[Constable Byron Ward]]

### Jailhouse

- **Description:** A small, unassuming building near the center of town, Mourn’s Folly Jailhouse has a stone foundation with weathered wooden walls and barred windows. It consists of only a few rooms: the constable's office, a single holding cell, and a small storage closet where basic supplies and confiscated items are kept. The jailhouse’s modesty reflects the typically quiet nature of the Folly—designed for the occasional rowdy traveler rather than hardened criminals.

- **Layout:**
    - **Constable’s Office:** A simple wooden desk and chair, a few shelves with record books, and a weapons rack that holds his pistol and mace when he’s off-duty.
	
    - **Holding Cell:** An iron-barred cell with a cot, a bucket, and a wooden bench. It’s rarely occupied, but is secure enough for temporary detainment.
	
    - **Storage Closet:** Contains ropes, shackles, a small collection of supplies, and Byron’s emergency bag (packed for his “quick exit” in case things go sideways).

The jailhouse reflects Constable Byron Ward's practicality and minimal commitment to law enforcement. It’s functional but not intimidating, suitable for detaining locals for minor offenses, though it lacks the resources to handle any serious threat—an unease Byron feels keenly as trouble brews in Mourn’s Folly.

## Lathander’s Vigil

### Backstory

Lathander’s Vigil, an heirloom pistol with intricate engravings and a faint inner glow, was inherited by Cedric upon the passing of his mentor, a devoted servant of the Morninglord who had been like a father to him. For Cedric, the weapon symbolized both his faith and the tenets instilled by his mentor—courage, light, and protection against darkness.

One night, after Cedric had been brought to the jail in a drunken stupor—an unfortunate but familiar occurrence over recent years—Constable Byron Ward took the pistol for safekeeping, not wanting the priest to accidentally harm himself or others. The next morning, however, when Cedric asked for his weapon back, Byron claimed he knew nothing of it. Too groggy to recall the night in full detail, Cedric has since harbored doubts about Byron’s claim but lacks any real proof.

The pistol, now hidden away, serves as a reminder of Cedric’s wavering faith and Byron’s disregard for the Morninglord’s teachings.


### Lathander’s Vigil

- **Description:**
	Known as Lathander’s Vigil, this finely crafted pistol is housed in a wooden box with the symbol of Lathander, the Morninglord, carved into its lid. Its barrel bears delicate etchings that glow faintly in sunlight or near holy sites, a testament to its divine blessing.

- **Properties:**
	Lathander’s Vigil is a +1 magical pistol, providing a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls. Once per long rest, it can release a burst of radiant energy, adding 1d6 radiant damage against undead foes, honoring Lathander’s light that wards against the darkness.

- **Special Condition:**
	When wielded by a follower of Lathander, the pistol exudes a faint warmth, as if the Morninglord’s presence is near. The wielder may hear faint whispers of guidance, strengthening their resolve in dark moments.

- **Location and Access:**
	The pistol, **Lathander’s Vigil**, is stored in a small, locked box bearing Lathander’s radiant sigil, which seems to faintly shimmer in the presence of true believers. The box is hidden in the bottom drawer of Constable Byron Ward’s desk, requiring either the key Byron carries or a successful **DC 15 Dexterity (Thieves' Tools)** check to access.

- **Access to the Box:**
	Once the drawer is opened, the box itself remains closed to all but those who hold genuine faith in Lathander. The box will reveal its contents only to individuals of deep faith, resonating with the Morninglord’s blessing to open seamlessly for the faithful.
