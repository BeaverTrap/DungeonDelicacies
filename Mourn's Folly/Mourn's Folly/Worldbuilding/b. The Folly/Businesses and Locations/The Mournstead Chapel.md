**Caretaker**: [[Father Cedric Halford, Priest of Lathander]]

### **Outside of Mournstead Chapel**

> Standing quietly at the center of Mourn’s Folly, **Mournstead Chapel** is an unassuming structure of weathered stone, its simplicity reflecting the humility of the town itself. Its modest steeple reaches just above the surrounding rooftops, crowned with a sun-shaped emblem crafted in polished brass that catches the light at dawn. Ivy clings to the stone walls, and beneath a gently sloping roof, arched windows of frosted glass give the building a serene, almost ethereal appearance. A small garden blooms at its entrance, filled with hardy herbs and bright marigolds that thrive under Lathander’s blessing. The chapel’s wooden doors, carved with symbols of the rising sun, seem to welcome all who approach, offering a silent promise of warmth and peace within.

### **Inside of Mournstead Chapel**

> The inside of **Mournstead Chapel** is warm and inviting, with wooden pews lined up along a central aisle, each polished smooth from years of use. The light filters softly through the frosted glass windows, casting gentle, shifting patterns across the stone floor. At the front of the room stands a simple altar draped in white cloth, upon which rests a carved sunburst symbol representing Lathander’s light. Brass sconces line the walls, ready to be lit in the evenings, casting a golden glow that fills every corner. The air is tinged with the faint scent of lavender and cedar, calming and timeless.
>
> Above the altar, a single, large window lets in the morning sun, illuminating the room in warm tones at dawn, a fitting tribute to the god of light and renewal. Wooden benches and small tables line the walls, where visitors leave small offerings or notes of gratitude and prayer. The atmosphere is one of reverence and simplicity, where even the smallest whisper feels like a sacred act, and every detail reminds visitors of Lathander’s gentle presence, promising hope and new beginnings.

## the Chapel

> **Mournstead Chapel**—lovingly referred to by townsfolk as the _Temple of the Dawn_, _House of the Rising Sun_, and _Lathander’s Light_—sits at the heart of Mourn’s Folly. It’s a modest yet cherished place of worship, simple and humble, reflecting the values of the town and their reverence for Lathander, god of dawn and renewal. Though small in size, the chapel holds a powerful warmth, embodying Lathander’s teachings of hope, healing, and new beginnings.
>
> Lathander, often called the Morninglord, is the god of light, spring, and rebirth. His followers believe he ushers in every sunrise, lifting the shadows of night and offering each new day as a chance to begin again. To the people of Mourn’s Folly, honoring him requires no grand display; instead, they show devotion through small acts of kindness, resilience, and creativity—qualities they see as embodying Lathander’s gentle grace.
>
> In troubled times, the chapel serves as a sanctuary. Townsfolk gather not just to worship, but to share burdens, seek healing, and find encouragement. The chapel stands humbly, much like the god it honors, as a steadfast light against the darkness—a place where even the most weary can find solace and the reassurance that every dawn brings new possibilities.

- In conversation, residents might refer to the Chapel as:
	- **Temple of the Dawn** – emphasizing its sacred role in protecting the town.
	- **House of the Rising Sun** – capturing the warmth and hope associated with Lathander.
	- **Lathander’s Light** – symbolizing it as a beacon of safety and guidance.

- **Protection**: The chapel grounds are hallowed, serving as a barrier against the undead. Vampires, including Barstow and his thralls, cannot cross the threshold or enter the sacred space, and any attempt would result in them recoiling in pain. This protection gives townsfolk a refuge if they come under threat, and Father Cedric makes the sanctuary available to anyone seeking safety.

- **Routine**: The chapel remains open for morning prayers and evening blessings, where Father Cedric speaks on themes of hope, resilience, and unity. During the day, he tends to the chapel grounds and offers guidance, healing, and solace to any who visit.

## Lathander Scrolls & Religious Text
#### Scroll of Lathander’s Light

> “Lathander, the Morninglord, Bringer of Light and Renewal, watches over all who seek to start anew. As each dawn lifts the shadows, so too does Lathander bring hope to the faithful. His light shines upon those who cherish life, who heal the wounded, who honor creation, and who bring compassion to all they meet. He is the promise that each day holds a chance for redemption, for renewal, and for great deeds to be done in his name.”

> “Lathander’s followers know the value of hard work and the courage to face the day’s challenges, for he smiles upon acts of bravery, kindness, and creativity. Artists, healers, and farmers find favor in his eyes, as their hands bring beauty, health, and sustenance to the world. The Morninglord grants strength to those who defend the innocent, and he bestows courage to those who shield the weak.”

> “His light repels darkness, and his presence is a balm to the weary and downtrodden. In times of shadow, in moments of despair, those who call upon the Morninglord may feel his warmth, a quiet reassurance that no darkness is so great that it cannot be undone by the light of dawn.”

#### Tales of Lathander: The Lightbringer’s Oath

> In the time before time, when the world was shadowed and the heavens first began their turn, Lathander arose from the dawn itself, bringing light to the heavens and warmth to the land. Where his gaze fell, life flourished, and with each sunrise, he cast out darkness anew, vowing never to let shadow reign unchallenged. The Morninglord, as he became known, took upon himself a solemn oath—to champion those who seek to create, to protect, and to restore hope.”

> “The faithful of Lathander know he cherishes life’s possibilities and second chances. There are countless tales told of him granting his blessing to healers and those who bring life into the world. Farmers find their fields more fertile in his light, and artists speak of the Morninglord’s touch as they work, believing his spirit is present in their creation. Lathander is also said to have a particular fondness for those who defend others, seeing each act of bravery as a spark that drives back night’s advance.”

> “In one legend, when an ancient city was plunged into darkness by a terrible curse, the people called upon Lathander. He cast his light upon the city’s walls, restoring color to its faded stones and strength to its weary people. From that day, it was said, any heart pure enough to feel his light would be forever renewed. The Morninglord became known as both a patron of dawn’s light and a warrior against despair, lending his strength to those who hold courage in the face of shadow.”

> “Even now, the followers of Lathander are reminded by his teachings that dawn always comes, that light returns even to the darkest hour. He teaches them to foster joy, to heal where others may harm, and to create beauty wherever they go. The Morninglord’s light may be a soft glow to soothe the weary or a blinding radiance to drive away evil; but always, it brings warmth, hope, and a promise that each day begins with a chance for new beginnings.”





### Notes of Father Cedric
#### **Sermons of Light**
*These are notes for a sermon Father Cedric was working on*

> _"Lathander, our Dawnbringer, brings with him each morning a renewal, a reminder that each day can be a step closer to the light. In the darkest of nights, remember, dawn always returns. As long as we keep faith, so too will Lathander keep us in his sight."_

> _"When we lose sight of hope, we forget that the dawn is not a distant wish but a promise. In every shadow, there is a sliver of light waiting to break through, if only we look for it."_

> _"Our strength is not only in the promise of a new day but in the courage to hold that promise when the darkness seems endless. We are Lathander's own light-bearers, standing firm against despair."_

#### **Personal Reflections**
This is the Person Journal of Father Cedric
- **Entry: Morning Doubts**
    > "How hollow my words feel these days. I preach of hope, of Lathander's light, yet my heart grows colder with each prayer. The nights seem to stretch longer, the dawn's promise further away. I cannot admit this to my congregation, nor to myself, but in the quiet hours, doubt gnaws at me. If only I could feel his warmth as I once did."
- **Entry: Alone in Faith**
    > "There was a time when I felt Lathander's presence, like a hand on my shoulder guiding me. Now, my prayers echo back emptily. I wonder if the darkness in this town is too thick for his light to reach. Is it my faith that has weakened, or has he turned his gaze from me?"
- **Entry: Crisis of Spirit**
    > "Today, I stumbled over my own words, a sermon turned to ramblings. I feel like an imposter, preaching strength in faith while mine crumbles beneath me. Perhaps Lathander has abandoned me as I’ve abandoned my belief. And if that’s true, then what protection do I truly offer to my flock in Mourn’s Folly?"
- **Entry: Lathander's Vigil Lost**
    > "How foolish of me, to hold onto such resentment over the loss of a single pistol. It is but a weapon, metal and powder, yet it gnaws at my thoughts daily as if it were a lost soul itself. In my clearer moments, I see how Byron could not be to blame. He’s never taken to the Light, never shared my path—but he’s no thief. Still, every time I catch sight of him, that dark whisper insists otherwise. It is a shameful thought, a weakness I cannot seem to shed.
    > I’ve prayed, time and again, for Lathander’s guidance to release this doubt. And yet, the Vigil’s absence feels more like a wound in me than an object misplaced. The guilt hangs heavier each night, especially as I take to that blasted flask. Lathander, forgive me. Is it so hard to believe that my failing memory in that night of drink could have betrayed me, that I simply lost it as I did my senses? I can almost feel my mentor’s disappointment, echoing through the shadows of each prayer.
    > I must find peace with this. It was my failure, not his. And still...the thought lingers."
- **Entry: A Bitter Sacrament**
    > "I speak of strength in the face of shadows, yet tonight I found myself reaching not for my prayer book but for the flask hidden under my robes. A sip here and there, to calm the nerves, or so I tell myself. But Lathander sees all, doesn't he? If he does, I wonder if he’s disappointed. It’s become my private solace, the bitter warmth that keeps my own darkness at bay. I preach of light, yet I drink to forget the darkness within."
- **Entry: Failing the Flock**
    > "Another night, another sermon given with the taste of brandy on my breath. It’s harder to keep the faith than it is to keep my hand from the bottle. My parishioners expect strength, yet I can barely muster the will to look them in the eye. I drown my doubts, hoping they’ll disappear. But no matter how many drinks I take, they remain, lurking in the back of my mind like a shadow cast by an unseen light."
- **Entry: A Slipping Grip**
    > "My flask is lighter tonight, but so am I. Lathander’s dawn comes with judgment as well as mercy, and I fear both. If my congregation knew... if anyone knew. I was supposed to be the beacon of hope in this town, the unshakable rock. And yet here I am, weakened and wavering, leaning on spirits that can’t save me. I feel my grip slipping, on the bottle, on my faith, on myself."
- **Entry: One More Night**
    > "I’ve promised myself—again—that tomorrow will be different. That I’ll put down the drink and return to the man I once was. But as the shadows lengthen, the flask finds its way back into my hand. Is it failure or comfort? I no longer know. All I know is that as my faith fades, the bottle grows heavier. How long can I keep hiding this from those who look to me for strength?"
