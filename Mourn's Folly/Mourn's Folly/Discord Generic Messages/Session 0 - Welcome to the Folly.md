@Group 1 – Welcome to **Mourn's Folly**!

We’ll be diving into our **Session 0** right here, so feel free to start building your characters, selecting backgrounds, and asking any questions that come to mind. If any of you need assistance with character creation on D&D Beyond, just let me know—I’m happy to walk through it with you or take care of the setup based on your ideas.

Your characters likely know each other, either as locals or recent arrivals with shared connections in the Folly. Discussing your backgrounds together is encouraged to weave your stories and motivations. If the provided backgrounds don’t quite fit, let’s work together to create something that brings your character to life in the Folly. Keep in mind that this is intended as a short, horror-filled one-shot, so we’re aiming for just one or two sessions of intense mystery and action.

I’m excited to run this for you and can’t wait to see where the story takes us. So gather your courage, steel your nerves, and prepare to uncover the secrets of **Mourn’s Folly**.
