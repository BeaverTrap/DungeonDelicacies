### Act 3
**Overview:**  
The PCs realize they’re dealing with something unnatural—Voss’s charming facade crumbles, and Barstow finally appears under terrifying circumstances. The mansion itself seems alive with malevolent energy, and Barstow’s true nature is revealed as he targets townsfolk or even a vulnerable NPC, like Father Cedric, as a warning.

**Key Moments:**

- **Showdown in the Mansion or Shop:** The PCs face Barstow and Voss, using clues they’ve uncovered to counter the supernatural threat.
- **Cedric’s Fall or Sacrifice:** In a dramatic twist, Cedric’s attempt to stand against Barstow fails, adding weight to the PCs’ struggle.
- **Final Battle or Resolution:** PCs must find a way to confront or trap Barstow, ending his reign of fear and ensuring the town’s safety.

**Goals:**

- Provide a climactic and challenging encounter for the PCs.
- Wrap up the mystery with a confrontation that allows for creative use of PCs’ strengths.
- Conclude with the town’s reaction—whether freed from Barstow’s influence or left haunted by new fears.
