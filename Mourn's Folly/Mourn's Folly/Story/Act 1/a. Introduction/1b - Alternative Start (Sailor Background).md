### The Crate’s Journey: An Ominous Loss

**Overview:**  
For PCs who are sailors or connected to the **Kendausk River** trade, the trip bringing Barstow’s crate to **Mourn’s Folly** is marked by an unsettling event. A relatively new crew member disappeared during the night, slipping overboard without a trace. Despite a search, no body was found, and the incident left an eerie silence hanging over the ship. The crew whispered uneasily, wondering if something unnatural caused the sailor’s disappearance, yet no one dared voice their suspicions openly.

>As your ship glides through the calm waters of the Kendausk River, the familiar creaks and groans of the vessel blend with the quiet sounds of night. The cargo hold is packed tightly, filled with a larger shipment than usual. Supplies and crates of all sizes are bound for Mourn’s Folly, including materials for the new antique shop and the long-abandoned Mournstead Mansion, now under restoration. It’s not uncommon to deliver goods to towns along the river, though the crew shares a bit of excitement about the bustling developments in the usually quiet Folly.

>Shortly after midnight, a sudden splash disrupts the silence. One of the newer crew members, on watch, is found missing. A quick search yields no sign of the sailor, but with nothing more to be done, the captain refocuses everyone, reminding them of the schedule and the importance of keeping on track for the delivery.

>When the ship finally reaches the docks of Mourn’s Folly, Marlon Voss is there waiting, eager to personally oversee the arrival of shipments for his new antique shop and the renovations at the old Mournstead Mansion. Dressed with refined taste, Voss directs the delivery with a calm, attentive air as townsfolk gather to watch each crate and bundle of materials carefully unloaded.

>With the initial delivery complete, the small crew prepares to stay in town for the next few days, awaiting additional shipments by land before continuing downriver. The familiar creaks of the ship fade into the town’s quiet buzz, pulling them into the subtle charm and mysteries of Mourn’s Folly.
