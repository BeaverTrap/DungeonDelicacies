### **Confrontation in the Cellar**

The PCs slip into Mournstead Mansion, navigating the darkened halls until they find the stairs leading down to the cellar. Descending carefully, they spot faint candlelight flickering below and hear low, murmured words as they approach. Just as they peek into the room, they witness Voss in the midst of a dark ritual, his eyes fixed upon the crate and the now-entranced delivery men.

A low, throaty whisper fills the air as the crate slowly creaks open, revealing the pale, monstrous figure of Walter Barstow. Barstow's gaze locks onto the PCs, his eyes gleaming with sudden fury at the disruption. With a sinister grin, Voss turns, his demeanor shifting from ritualistic calm to cold malice.

#### **Battle in the Cellar**

- **Fight Initiation:** Voss, realizing the ritual has been interrupted, attacks the PCs in an attempt to either eliminate them or drive them away. He fights with desperate ferocity, determined to keep them from interfering further.

- **Barstow’s Escape:** Barstow, momentarily weakened from his slumber, lets out a guttural hiss and launches himself toward the mansion’s exit. His vampiric form is quick and silent, slipping past the PCs and up the stairs with unnerving speed. 

- His only refuge now is to take over a house within one of the neighbor hoods, .

### **Consequences of the Confrontation**

- **Voss’s Survives:** After Barstow’s escape, Voss becomes a dangerous enemy, deeply committed to restoring his master’s hold on the town. He will continue to work behind the scenes, using his connections and charm to rally support among the townsfolk and protect Barstow.

- **Voss's Death**:
  Barstow has no one to help his takeover of the town, so Barstow starts a vicious take over of the town, not creating any thralls, but instead just [[Feral Vampire Spawn]]
    
- **Barstow’s Safe Haven:** Fleeing to the antique shop, Barstow can now only operate from within its confines. This forced relocation also limits his influence, giving the PCs time to rally support and investigate further.
