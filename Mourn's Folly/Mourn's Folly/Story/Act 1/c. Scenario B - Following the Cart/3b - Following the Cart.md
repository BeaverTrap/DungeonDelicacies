### **Following or Intervening with the Cart**

The PCs may notice Marlon Voss paying special attention to a large, ominous crate among the other deliveries. If they decide to follow the cart or intervene, they’ll encounter challenges:

**Intervening Options:**

- **Distraction:** PCs can distract the delivery men or Voss, but this requires multiple successful rolls at DC 22 (Persuasion or Deception) to keep them occupied.
- **Stealth Check (DC 22):** To tail the cart unseen, the PCs need to stay close without alerting the delivery men or Voss.

**Attempting to Unlock or Open the Crate:**

- **Thieves’ Tools (DC 25):** Lockpicking to open the crate is challenging, especially with Voss and the men nearby. If the PCs don’t continuously distract them, they risk being caught.
- **Strength Check (DC 22):** If the PCs try to force the crate open, they’ll need a high roll to even budge it.

> **If the Cart is Significantly Delayed**  
> Should the PCs successfully stall the cart through any means, a creature within begins stirring, causing the crate to splinter and a bat-like figure to escape into the forest, disappearing into the night.

### **Unseen Secrets in the Cellar**

If the PCs shadow the delivery to Mournstead Mansion without directly intervening, they observe from a hidden spot as Marlon Voss leads the delivery men to the cellar doors. After instructing them to carefully unload the heavy crate, he murmurs something under his breath—a brief, reverent phrase in an unknown language, his tone almost worshipful. This phrase resonates subtly in the air, as if awakening something dormant.

Once the crate is placed securely in the cellar, Voss takes a long look at it before moving to secure the doors. He locks them with a heavy, ancient key, whispering another incantation that causes a faint shimmer to flash around the doorframe, forming an ethereal barrier. This is no ordinary lock—its magic seals the room completely, obscuring sight and sound from both sides.

> PCs must remain hidden to avoid detection. Any sudden movements or sounds could draw unwanted attention.

#### **The Cellar Barrier**

- **Magical Barrier:** The magical lock on the cellar doors is a high-level arcane barrier. It prevents any sound or magical scrying from penetrating it, rendering the cellar and its contents completely imperceptible from the outside.

- **Investigation (DC 18):** PCs examining the area can sense faint traces of magic, realizing that even with access to the cellar door, something far stronger than a regular lock holds it shut.


### **Stealthy Entry to the Cellar from Inside the Manor**

The PCs arrive at the manor and face the challenge of sneaking in without alerting anyone inside. The front door is locked, but a few windows on the ground floor offer potential entry points.

#### **Front Door Lock (DC 15)**

- **Dexterity (Thieves' Tools) Check (DC 15):** PCs attempting to pick the lock need a successful Dexterity check. A failure might make subtle noise, potentially drawing Voss’s attention. Success grants them access through the front without any disruption.

#### **Finding the Cellar Entrance**

Once inside, the atmosphere is thick with silence, broken only by faint echoes from below. PCs searching for the cellar spot a door hidden in the shadows of an alcove, leading to a narrow staircase.

#### **Navigating the Stairway Trap**

The cellar stairway is narrow, with most steps intact but some removed, creating a hidden drop. The faint gleam of knife points sticks out from the bottom, hinting at a deadly trap.

- **Perception Check (DC 12):** Discerns the missing steps just as they reach the top.

- **Investigation Check (DC 15):** Clearly reveals the trap below.


#### **Rope Descent and Stealth**

- **Dexterity Check (DC 10) to Tie a Rope Securely:** PCs can anchor the rope for a controlled descent. Failing this check may cause slight noise or movement, alerting anyone nearby.

- **Dexterity (Acrobatics) Check (DC 13):** Careful descent using the rope avoids the deadly knives.

### **Observing the Ritual**

Successfully entering the cellar undetected gives PCs a glimpse of Voss preparing the crate while Barstow remains hidden, setting up an unsettling scene.

- **Stealth Check (DC 18):** Observing PCs must remain quiet, or risk catching Voss's attention, and possibly ending up as witnesses... or the next victims.
