### **Scene: Voss’s Ritual with the Delivery Men**

As the heavy crate is carefully maneuvered into the cellar of Mournstead Mansion, Marlon Voss dismisses the workers with an icy calm. However, when they turn to leave, he quickly and efficiently knocks out one of the men, catching the unconscious body before it can hit the ground. The remaining delivery man freezes, horror dawning on his face.

Voss turns to him, his eyes glinting with a sinister gleam. “You serve as tribute to my lord of flies,” he murmurs, his voice dripping with dark reverence. The delivery man stumbles backward, terror in his eyes, but with nowhere to go, he lunges desperately at Voss.

Voss sidesteps with an unsettling grace, his hand seizing the man’s collar in a vice-like grip. The man struggles, but it’s too late—Walter Barstow, pale and bat-like, emerges from the shadows, his gaunt form drifting with silent menace. Before the man can scream, Barstow’s jaws are upon him, draining his life in a matter of moments as Voss watches, unperturbed.

With the bodies dealt with, Voss bows his head momentarily in twisted reverence, as if to honor his dark lord. He quickly wipes away any traces of the sacrifice and disposes of the men’s belongings, ensuring no sign of struggle remains.
