**Scene Setup:** Just as the delivery crate is transported toward the manor, the PCs and townsfolk are alerted by a sudden commotion in the town square. A crowd gathers, watching in disbelief as a figure staggers in from the direction of the river.

**Description of the Sailor’s State:**

- The missing sailor from the previous night stumbles into town, covered in river muck and reeds. His skin is sickly pale, tinged greenish from his time underwater, and his eyes have a hollow, almost lifeless look. Bits of his clothing are torn, and small bite marks mar his arms, as though scavengers nibbled on him during his time in the river.

- His movements are jerky and slow, his gaze unfocused, yet he mutters about “the darkness” or something that “drags from the deep,” heightening the eerie tone without directly revealing his transformation.

- The sailor suddenly lunges at a nearby townsfolk, teeth bared, biting down weakly, almost as if he’s compelled by an overwhelming hunger rather than aggression.

**The Sailor’s “Companions”:**

- Trailing behind him are a few vagabonds or town stragglers who seem similarly afflicted, their skin similarly pallid and eyes lifeless. They move with sluggish, clumsy steps and occasionally moan or mutter incoherently.

- These followers aren’t full-fledged vampires or zombies but are in a weakened, feral state—a low form of vampiric thrall created by Barstow’s indirect influence. They retain none of their former selves, acting on a primal urge to feed.

> As dusk settles over Mourn’s Folly, a distant commotion stirs near the town square. Townsfolk murmur, gathering in clusters, their voices low with worry. Emerging from the shadows near the docks is a lone figure—a man stumbling forward, his steps slow and unsteady. Some of the crew from the Kendausk recognize him immediately: the sailor who went missing just last night.
>
> His skin is ghostly pale, tinged with a sickly green, and glistens as rivulets of murky river water drip from his torn clothes, which are heavy with reeds and muck. His eyes, unfocused and glassy, stare straight ahead. A low, guttural groan escapes his lips as he stumbles closer, his movements jerky and unnatural.
>
> One of his fellow crew members steps forward, reaching out cautiously, but as they draw near, the sailor lurches forward, mouth agape, as if to bite. A collective gasp ripples through the crowd as he lets out another eerie groan, his eyes fixed with a strange, vacant hunger.
>
> Moments later, more figures emerge from the dimly lit streets near the water’s edge. Each one appears as waterlogged and lifeless as the sailor, moving with the same shuffling, disjointed gait. Panic spreads through the crowd as villagers and crew alike pull back, some calling for the town guard, others retreating in shock and fear, whispering of a strange curse or illness overtaking the lost sailor.
>
> The figures advance, undeterred by the fearful murmurs and widening circle of townsfolk. Their blank expressions and sluggish movements draw everyone’s focus to the immediate threat at hand.

### **For the PCs:**

- **Immediate Challenge:** PCs are now forced to engage, as these semi-feral beings attack any townsfolk nearby. PCs can attempt to subdue them without lethal force, but if they get close, they’ll notice the sailor and his followers try to bite or claw at them.

- **Checks to Uncover Clues:**
    
    - **Medicine Check (DC 13):** Reveals that the sailor’s wounds suggest he’s been underwater for hours and that he’s suffering from an unnatural pallor, resembling an early stage of vampiric transformation.
	
    - **Insight or Religion Check (DC 15):** A successful check might hint at dark magic or undeath, though they won’t immediately suspect vampires. PCs may suspect some form of necromancy or curse that brought the sailor back in a degraded, mindless state.

- **Aftermath and Repercussions:** After neutralizing the threat, PCs and townsfolk may discuss the strange nature of the “undead” sailor, with locals fearful that this “plague” might spread. This buys time for Barstow’s crate to arrive unnoticed in the mansion, heightening the mystery.

### **Outcome and Consequences:**

- **Distraction from the Mansion’s Events:** This zombie-like incident captures the PCs’ attention, effectively diverting them from following the crate to the cellar.

- **Building Suspicion:** The incident foreshadows Barstow’s vampiric influence while leaving the PCs in the dark about the true nature of what’s happening in Mourn’s Folly.

- **Further Investigation:** PCs may choose to trace the sailor’s origin, which subtly leads back to Barstow’s machinations without revealing his full power. They’ll begin piecing together that something far darker than they expected is affecting the town.


### **After the fight**
if the PCs inspect the bodies, they notice the following:

- The corpses have bite marks, though they’re irregular, ragged, and partially torn as if the bites were made by a human but lacked control.

- Due to bruising and signs of decomposition, the marks are indistinct and unclear, obscuring any specific pattern.

**DC 15 Medicine or Investigation Check**:

- **Success (15 or higher):** The PCs recognize that the bites are human but erratic, suggesting the attacker may have been in a frenzied state.

- **Failure (14 or lower):** The PCs are unable to discern anything specific due to the bloating and decay of the flesh.
