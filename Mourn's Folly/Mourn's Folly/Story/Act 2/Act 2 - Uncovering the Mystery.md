### Act 2
**Overview:**  
As night falls, peculiar events begin to disrupt the town’s peace. Odd noises from the mansion, rumors of sightings, and townsfolk feeling “watched” increase tensions. The PCs might investigate the mansion or antique shop more closely, with clues hinting at Barstow’s strange “arrival” through secretive means. The town’s quiet streets become foreboding, and the PCs encounter obstacles—both natural and supernatural.

**Key Moments:**

- **Investigation of the Mansion and Shop:** PCs find strange symbols, cold drafts, or unsettling artifacts that suggest a dark presence.
- **Mysterious Encounters:** Rumors escalate, with some locals insisting they saw a figure in the mansion’s windows or hearing whispers at night.
- **Confrontation with Father Cedric or Another Elder:** An encounter with someone knowledgeable (like Cedric) reveals hints about a “curse” or legends of creatures who prey upon the living.

**Goals:**

- Heighten the mystery and stakes by adding tension.
- Start revealing pieces of Barstow’s history or a hint of his true nature.
- Move the PCs toward a confrontation or a decision on how to act.
